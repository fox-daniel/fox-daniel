I solve busines problems through data science and software engineering. Beginning with the MVP, I iterate using profiling and testing to achieve performant systems and derive actionable insights based on well-tested and well-documented code. Experienced solving complex geospatial data challenges through cross-team collaboration, I can draw on ML and statistics in my engineering. With two PhDs in math and music I take an agile approach to solving novel challenges that increase business value.

Personal projects:

- Co-authored the Rust crate [`iterative_methods`](https://crates.io/crates/iterative_methods)
	- (Weighted) Reservoir Sampling implemented, tested, and demonstrated with visualizations for a 
	- YAML adaptor for writing data to file as part of an iterative method
- [Gender bias](https://github.com/fox-daniel/Genre) in music genre labels in Wikipedia
	- 2nd Place Award for NYC Digital Humanities Graduate Student Project
	- Ï‡-square test showing that female artists are significantly under-represented among all
	artists with >5 genre labels
	- Scrape, clean and normalize culturally complex text labels (genres) from Wikipedia
	- Based on a Kaggle dataset of 15K musicians with gender labels
- Implemented a [random forest algorithm](https://github.com/fox-daniel/random_forest) from scratch in Python
	- Used cProfile to find the bottlenecks and make targeted optimizations that improved the speed by more than 100x over the initial design
	- Use PyTest for automated testing
