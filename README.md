I approach software engineering by developing well-tested and well-documented code. Beginning with the MVP, I iterate using tools such as profiling and testing to achieve performant systems and derive actionable insights. Excited to work on data management challenges, I can draw on ML and statistics in my engineering. With two PhDs in math and music I take an agile approach to solving novel challenges that increase business value.

Recent projects:

	- (Weighted) Reservoir Sampling implemented, tested, and demonstrated with visualizations for a 
	- YAML adaptor for writing data to file as part of an iterative method
